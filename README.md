Jupyter notebooks for scseq analysis and Seurat Metadata showing cluster ID for each cell in the analysis shown in Wallace et al, 2020 eLife

For the metadata taken from Seurat 'habenula_seurat_meta.RData', has all the clusters from Figure 1B of Wallace et al, 2020 in the column 'cellclassnames_filtered'.  The two other files are the metadata for the MHb (Figure 2) and LHb (figure 3), I included these because there was additional subclustering I performed on the neuronal clusters as well as regressing out activity dependent genes, etc.  For these two files the cluster identity is in the column 'tree.ident'.
